* Installed Openfire, set up server. Seems simple enough. 
* Started reading up on XMPP, whether BASH handles it or not, and Python stuff. BASH seems to have what I need, but it seems worryingly simple. Might have to use Python to handle some more complex things if I'm going that route.


### 2021/07/25
